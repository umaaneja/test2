You are helping me generate a Laravel paragraph type. I'm migrating a Drupal site to Laravel, and each Drupal paragraph maps to a Laravel model with its own table, form, and Blade layout.

## Paragraph Type: GalleryBlock

## Fields:
- title (string)
- description (text)
- images (json) â€” array of image paths
- background_color (string, optional)

## Requirements:
1. Create a model: `App\Models\GalleryBlock`
2. Create a migration for the table `gallery_blocks`
3. Add `$fillable` for all fields
4. Create a Blade view: `resources/views/paragraphs/galleryblock.blade.php`
   - Render title and description
   - Loop through images and show them in a Bootstrap grid
   - Use background_color as a div style if set
5. Integrate with the Paragraph plugin (polymorphic):
   - This model must be able to be related to the `Paragraph` model via `morphMany`
   - Must support creating/updating via paragraph CRUD
6. Optional: Include a Seeder that creates one sample GalleryBlock
5. Don't do anything in the parent paragraph plugin. This should be a fully self-contained paragraph type.
